SERVICE ROLES
-------------
There seems to be a dependency on every node knowing the service role for every possible zone value.\
Without this there are cryptic errors after the zone transfer action, with no useful logs.

DATA SOURCES
------------
The most natural option is for each region to have a single independent default data source.\
Multi region data sources introduce reliability problems when there is no zone value.\
This also ensures that a US instance cannot possibly write data to an EU database.

SWITCHING BETWEEN ZONES
-----------------------
This does not seem to work reliably if you log in via OAuth tools.\
Login as user `testuser.eu` and then login as user `testuser.us`.\
This fails with an error and nothing in logs, then works after a retry.
