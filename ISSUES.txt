MULTI REGION DATA SOURCE
------------------------
Multi region data sources do not seem to save correctly, due to a missing plugin error.\
Maybe I am missing a piece of the puzzle here.

ZONE TRANSFER ACTION
--------------------
This doesn't seem to be executing currently, though previously I could see it in Charles Proxy.\
This resulted in a zone cookie being written.

SWITCHING BETWEEN ZONES
-----------------------
Previously I used two different config.xml files for Europe and USA.\
In OAuth Tools, I logged in as user `testuser.eu` and then login as user `testuser.us`.\
This failed, with nothing written to logs, then worked after a retry.

DROPPED COOKIES?
----------------
I would expect multiple login attempts from OAuth tools to use the SSO cookie.\
However, I get prompted to login every time and would like to understand this better.

ZONES AND SERVICE ROLE ERROR REPORTING
--------------------------------------
When the zone is not associated to a service role an authentication error occurs.\
However, nothing written to logs, and an improved log message would be useful.
